/**
 * Tool-adoption analysis over Claude Code transcripts.
 *
 * The problem this solves: we tune the Assessor/Atlas MCP instructions based on
 * whether agents actually call those tools at the moments that warrant it — and
 * until now the only evidence was agents' own self-reports. Those are unreliable
 * by construction: an agent that never noticed a trigger will, when asked, produce
 * a fluent post-hoc justification indistinguishable from a real decision. That is
 * precisely the confabulation the "report the skip you ACTUALLY made" instruction
 * exists to counter, and it cannot be fixed by asking harder.
 *
 * So we do not ask. Transcripts under ~/.claude/projects record every tool call
 * AND the surrounding assistant text, with timestamps. Both signals we need are
 * already on disk:
 *
 *   TIER 1 (usage): did this session call assessor/atlas at all? Counted from
 *   tool_use blocks — deterministic, no model cooperation, and retrospective over
 *   every session ever run rather than only those after a hook was installed.
 *
 *   TIER 2 (missed triggers): did the session contain evidence that a documented
 *   trigger applied? Matched against the same conditions encoded in the server
 *   instructions (editing a failing test, asserting WHY after a git command,
 *   hedging about history). A match with no corresponding call is a CANDIDATE
 *   miss — the denominator that usage counts alone cannot give us.
 *
 * Tier 2 is a heuristic and is reported as candidates, never verdicts. Expect
 * false positives: not every "presumably" after a git command is an unverified
 * intent claim. The value is a short, checkable list, not a score.
 *
 * Everything here is read-only and local: it opens transcript files the user
 * already has and writes nothing back.
