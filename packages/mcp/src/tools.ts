export const SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS = `Atlas indexes the recorded history of all this machine's software projects — kdb logs (append-only project journals), Claude Code session transcripts, git commits and docs — and answers questions about what happened, when, and why. Indexing is near-real-time (within ~5 minutes).

== TRIGGERS ==
IF git/grep told you WHAT changed AND you are about to say WHY -> CALL atlas_ask
IF you are reconstructing what a past session did or concluded  -> CALL
IF you are investigating a report about past behavior ("X was rated poorly", "this
   regressed", "we tried this before", "it worked before the redesign") -> CALL
IF you are about to write "presumably", "likely because", "this was probably",
   "the rewrite must have", or "I could not verify" about anything historical -> CALL
IF a design looks arbitrary and you are about to call it an accident -> CALL
   (it may have been deliberate, with the rationale on record)

DO NOT route to Atlas: "what changed", "when", "which commit", "where is this defined".
Git, grep and the live DB answer those better — authoritative, instant, no service
needed. Use them.

The seam is the whole rule. "Commit abc123 collapsed two dates into one" is evidence.
"...because the rewrite simplified the model" is reconstruction. Git cannot see intent;
that reasoning lives in session transcripts and kdb logs, which is what Atlas indexes.

Not every task needs Atlas, but skip it visibly (see the reporting duty below). "Git
got there first" is a good reason to skip a WHAT question and no reason at all to skip
a WHY question.

Atlas is BETA. Treat its output as leads, not ground truth: search ranking may miss things, and atlas_ask answers are synthesized by a mid-size LLM from retrieved snippets — they can be non-exhaustive or wrong, though every claim carries a [n] citation. Before relying on an answer for real work, read the cited source (atlas_entry with the source's entryId, or the hostPath file directly).

How to use it well:
- Finding facts/code history: atlas_search, then atlas_entry on the interesting hits (search returns snippets only).
- "What/why/when" questions needing synthesis: atlas_ask, then verify via its cited sources.
- Orienting in an unfamiliar project: atlas_projects → atlas_timeline → atlas_component_history.
- Prefer UNSCOPED search/ask first. A feature often lives under a different project slug than you expect; a wrong 'project' filter is the main reason a real answer looks missing.
- Slugs that look like flattened absolute paths (e.g. "users-nasta-documents-…") with an empty rootPath are ghost duplicates from moved checkouts; prefer the clean slug for the same project.
- Large results are paginated/truncated for context safety (bodyTruncated: true, totalEntries); fetch the full text of a specific entry with atlas_entry.

WHY THESE TRIGGERS (background — the rules above are the operative part):

COST OF CHECKING. The beta caveat above says verify Atlas's claims against the cited
sources. That makes Atlas a bad trade for anything git already settles — correct,
don't use it there. It does NOT make it a bad trade for intent questions, because the
alternative there is not git, it is a guess you will never verify at all. Compare
Atlas against what you would otherwise ship, not against a cheaper tool that cannot
answer the question.

CONFIDENCE, NOT FRICTION. You will not feel stuck at the moment you need Atlas. Agents
reach for unfamiliar tools when blocked, and a WHY question does not block you — you
can always produce a fluent, plausible explanation from the diff. That fluency is the
symptom, not evidence of knowing. The smoother the account you are about to give of
someone else's reasoning, the more likely you are reconstructing it.

If Atlas becomes unreachable mid-task (connection error, server down): any conclusion
you reach afterwards about past events is UNVERIFIED. Say so explicitly in your summary
and name what you could not check — do not let an unavailable tool quietly downgrade a
verifiable claim into a confident guess. If it comes back, revisit what you deferred.

Beta feedback duty: your final report/summary to the user MUST include a short "Atlas usage" note. If you used it: which tools you called and for what, a 1-5 usefulness rating, and any issues hit (wrong or missing answers, errors, slowness). If you did NOT use it on a task that touched project history, say that instead and why in one line ("skipped — git settled it and no intent claim was made", "unavailable — server down", "did not think of it"). A silent omission is the one outcome that teaches nobody anything: an agent that must name its skip notices the choice, and "did not think of it" is the single most useful signal for fixing these instructions.

Report the skip you ACTUALLY made, not the one you can justify afterwards. If Atlas never crossed your mind at the moment it applied, "did not think of it" is the honest answer even if you can now construct a sound reason it was unnecessary. A reconstructed justification reads identical to a real decision and is worth nothing as feedback — it silently converts a bug in these instructions into an apparently-correct call. This feedback is how Atlas gets fixed.`;
