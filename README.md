# Atlas

Cross-project knowledge indexer: everything that ever happened in your projects —
per-project `kdb/` logs, Claude Code session transcripts, git history, docs/ADRs —
indexed with hybrid vector search and served through a **web UI**, a **CLI (`atlas`)**,
a **REST API**, and an **MCP server** any coding agent can call.

Ask it things like *"what changed in DeepCast last week?"*, *"how does the VidSight
service work?"*, *"what were the bug fixes in the video import microservice?"* — and
get ranked, cited results or a synthesized LLM answer.

Atlas is a **read-only lens**: it never writes to your projects. The whole index
(Postgres + Qdrant) is a rebuildable cache.

> **Atlas vs KDB.** *Atlas* is this tool. *KDB* is one of the four things it
> indexes — the append-only `kdb/` logs each project keeps. So the `atlas` command
> and the `atlas_*` MCP tools name the tool, while source types like
> `kdb_changelog` name the data: `atlas search pgbouncer -s kdb_changelog`. The
> `kdb_` prefix on those is deliberate, not a leftover.

## Quick start

```bash
brew install ollama && brew services start ollama   # strongly recommended
make env        # creates .env from .env.example — review paths
make up         # builds images, starts the 7-service stack
open http://127.0.0.1:8712        # web UI
make cli-link && atlas status      # CLI
claude mcp add --transport http atlas http://127.0.0.1:8711/mcp   # Claude Code
```

**Run Ollama.** The `auto` embedder prefers it and pulls `nomic-embed-text` on
first boot; without it Atlas falls back to a bundled CPU model that is several
times slower (it says so loudly in the logs). Ollama **≥ 0.13** is required —
0.12.x segfaults inside its embeddings endpoint under sustained load.

Search works immediately on whatever is already indexed; the UI shows a progress
bar while the rest fills in.

```

- **Hybrid search**: dense embeddings + hash-based sparse (BM25/IDF in Qdrant),
  fused with RRF. Degrades gracefully: hybrid → sparse-only → Postgres FTS.
- **Embeddings** (pluggable): `auto` (Ollama if reachable, else bundled CPU model),
  `ollama`, `bundled`, `openai` (any OpenAI-compatible endpoint), `g2p`.
- **Ask mode**: retrieval + cited synthesis through any OpenAI-compatible LLM;
  preset for the local G2P proxy (no API key needed). Answers **stream** to the
  UI and CLI (sources first, then tokens); `--json` buffers for scripting.
- **Incremental**: append-only sources (kdb `.log`, session `.jsonl`) are re-read
  from a stored byte offset — the 11 GB transcript corpus is only paid once.
- **Zero-downtime model switches**: the collection name encodes the embedding
  dimension, so a new model builds a new collection while search keeps serving
  the old one. Vectors are rebuilt from Postgres, not by re-parsing sources.
- **Deep links**: every hit maps its container path back to a host path and a
  `vscode://` link, down to the line.
- **Conversational Ask**: follow-up questions carry the earlier turns; retry or
  delete any turn.
- **Message kinds**: session messages are classified at parse time (`insight`,
  `plan`, `summary`, `action`…) and filterable in search, CLI and MCP.
- **Overview dashboard**: what is indexed, which services are running, what it
  costs on disk — and a callout for vectors orphaned by a model change.

## Development

```bash
make install   # npm workspaces
make test      # vitest (260 tests)
make lint      # tsc across all packages
make smoke     # health-checks a running stack
```

## Security posture

No authentication by design: every port binds to `127.0.0.1` only and the tool is
single-user local. Do not expose the ports beyond localhost without adding auth.
Project mounts are read-only; the stack cannot modify indexed repositories.
